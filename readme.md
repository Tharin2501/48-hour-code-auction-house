### 48-hour code: Auction House
This application is a auction house website where users can register items that they want to sell, with a starting price, and other users can bid on those (each time going over the current highest price).

The whole project was coded in 48-hours as that was the time limit of this exam

Tasks Completed: I did requirements R1, R2, R3 + T1, T2, T3 
and most of T4.

Tasks Not Completed: T5, R4, R5
